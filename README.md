# Todo List
This was a project I created while trying to familiarize myself with my first frontend framework. I chose React.js and
used online resources like codeacademy, youtube, and stack overflow to create the frontend functionality of this app.

<br>
Challenges I came across: 
<ul>
<li>"Climbing the tree" with sending data between components</li>
<li>Styling with JSX</li>
<li>Keeping track of importing and exporting components and where to use them</li>
</ul>

<br>
What I learned
<ul>
<li>Deeper understanding with components, state, and props</li>
<li>Javascript map and filter functions</li>
<li>How to create a React App</li>
</ul>
